					<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>
						Welcome to Breathe Easy. We are a small Charitable Organization that focus on Your Mental Wellbeing. We operate with both trained councillors and experienced volunteers to offer you the best support available. We work closely with Pieta House especially with the Darkness into Light campaign. We have a dedicated team who are always on hand to respond to your queries. We have councillors who specialise in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders including autism. You don’t have to have to struggle with your mental health to talk to us, sometimes it just nice to talk to a stranger and get things off your chest.
